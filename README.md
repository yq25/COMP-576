## Course description

This course explored deep learning, multistage machine learning methods that learn representations of complex data. We learned and implemented deep learning architectures for computer vision and natural language processing applications. The models covered in the course range from Deep-Convolutional-Networks-based systems such as VGG net and Residual Net to recurrent architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM-based models.

## Project description

In this project, we perform a time series prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network regressor. For this example, we predicted Apple's stock price 7 days in advance.

The particular network architecture we will employ for my RNN is a Long Term Short Memory (LTSM), which helps significantly avoid technical problems with optimization of RNNs.
