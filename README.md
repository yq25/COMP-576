# ELEC/COMP 576 - Introduction to Deep Learning ðŸŽ„
 by Dong An (da53), Yunneng Qian (yq25), Mingze Yuan, Qixuan Zheng (qz39).
 
## Course description

This course explored deep learning, multistage machine learning methods that learn representations of complex data. We learned and implemented deep learning architectures for computer vision and natural language processing applications. The models covered in the course range from Deep-Convolutional-Networks-based systems such as VGG net and Residual Net to recurrent architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM-based models.
